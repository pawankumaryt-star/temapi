*PN Temp Mail is a fast, secure, and fully self-hosted disposable email service built on React (Vite) and deployed through Cloudflare Pages & Workers. It uses Cloudflare D1 as its database layer and Cloudflare Email Routing to receive mail in real time.*

*One of the biggest advantages of this project is that it runs entirely on Cloudflare's free tier. <font color="green">Cloudflare Pages, Workers, and D1 Database all offer generous lifetime free usage</font>, making this an extremely cost-effective solution for personal projects and production-ready deployments without any hosting expenses.*

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

Follow the steps below in order — the sequence matters, especially the worker/pages naming and binding steps.

---

### 1️⃣ Fork the Repository

- Fork this repository to your own GitHub account:
  ```
  https://github.com/botolmehedi/tempmail-cloudflare
  ```

---

### 2️⃣ Create a Free Cloudflare Account

- Sign up or log in at **https://cloudflare.com**
- Make sure you added/connect the domains you plan to use for temporary email addresses added to your account (e.g. `abc123.net`, `abc123.com`, `abc-ai.com`, `abc123.app`).

- Also you need CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN. To create your `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, sign in to your Cloudflare account, open **My Profile**, and go to the **API Tokens** section. Click **Create Token**, choose **Create Custom Token**, and grant only the following permissions: **Email Security DMARC Reports: Read & Write**, **Cache Settings: Write**, **Email Routing Rules: Write**, **Zone: Read & Write**, and **DNS: Write**. After configuring the permissions, create the token, copy it immediately, and store it in a secure location, as Cloudflare will only display the token once.

---

### 3️⃣ Set Your Temp Mail Domains

Before deploying, open the file:

```
src/lib/tempmail-api.ts
```

```
worker/src/index.ts
```

Add the domain name(s) you want to use as your temporary email domains. This must be done **before** you deploy the project as a Worker or a Page, otherwise the generated addresses won't match your Email Routing setup.

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Cloudflare D1)

### 4️⃣ Create the D1 Database

You can do this either from the Dashboard or via terminal.

**Option A — Dashboard:**
1. Go to **Storage & Databases → D1**
2. Click **Create Database**
3. Name it, for example: `tempmail-db`

**Option B — Terminal:**
```bash
npx wrangler d1 create tempmail-db
```

---

### 5️⃣ Import the Schema

1. Open your newly created database → **Explore Data** (or run it via terminal)
2. Open the file `worker/schema.sql` from the repo
3. Copy the schema and run it against your database

**Via terminal:**
```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler d1 execute tempmail-db --file=schema.sql
```

⚠️ *If importing manually through the dashboard query editor, paste and run the schema section by section instead of all at once — pasting everything together can sometimes prevent all tables from being created properly.*

---

### 6️⃣ Add Your Database ID

Copy the **Database UUID** and **Database Name** from the D1 dashboard, then paste them into:

- `worker/wrangler.toml`
- `wrangler.jsonc`

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "tempmail-db"
database_id = "your-database-uuid-here"
```

---

## ☁️ Deploy the Project

⚠️ *Important: Deploy the project as a **Worker first**, then deploy it as **Pages**. Your Worker project name must exactly match the name you set in `wrangler.toml` / `wrangler.jsonc`. For example, if the name field says `tempmail-api`, your deployed Worker must also be named `tempmail-api`.*

### 7️⃣ Deploy as a Worker

**Via Website:**

1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to:  
   **Compute → Pages & Workers → Create Application**
3. Select **Import an existing Git repository**
4. Connect your **GitHub account** & Then Select the **forked repository**.

**Via terminal:**

```bash
cd worker
npm install
npm run deploy
```

**Build Configuration:**

Use the following settings:

- **Build Command:**  
  ```
  npm install && npm run build
  ```
- **Deploy command:**  

Replace `pn-temp-mail` with your **Pages project name**—the name you chose/want to use when deploy the Pages project, **not** your Worker name.

  ```
  npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=pn-temp-mail
  ```
- **Output Directory:**  
  ```
  dist
  ```
- **Root Directory:**  
  ```
  /
  ```  
**Add Environment Variables:**

- **Variable Name:** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`  
- **Value:** `true`  
- **Type:** Text  


Save the configuration and proceed with deployment.

---

Then bind the database to the Worker:

1. Go to **Compute → Pages & Workers**
2. Select your deployed Worker project
3. Go to **Settings → Bindings → Add Binding**
4. Choose **D1 Database**
5. Set:
   - **Variable Name:** `DB`
   - **Database:** select the database you created (e.g. `tempmail-db`)
6. Save changes

---

### 8️⃣ Deploy as Pages

**Via Website:**

1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to:  
   **Compute → Pages & Workers → Create Application**
3. Click Looking to deploy Pages? **Get started** 
4. Select **Import an existing Git repository**
5. Connect your **GitHub account** & Then Select the **forked repository**.

**Via terminal:**

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=tempmail
```

**Build Configuration:**

Use the following settings:

- **Framework Preset:** React (Vite)  
- **Build Command:**  
  ```
  npm install && npm run build
  ```
- **Output Directory:**  
  ```
  dist
  ```
- **Root Directory:**  
  ```
  /
  ```  

**Add Environment Variables:**

- **Variable Name:** `SKIP_DEPENDENCY_INSTALL`  
- **Value:** `true`  
- **Type:** Text

- **Variable Name:** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`  
- **Value:** `true`  
- **Type:** Text  


Save the configuration and proceed with deployment.

---

Then bind the same database to the Pages project, exactly the same way:

1. Go to **Compute → Pages & Workers**
2. Select your deployed Pages project
3. Go to **Settings → Bindings → Add Binding**
4. Choose **D1 Database**
5. Set:
   - **Variable Name:** `DB`
   - **Database:** select the same database (e.g. `tempmail-db`)
6. Save changes

---

### 9️⃣ Set .env File Variables

Update your `.env.production` file to point to your **deployed Pages URL** — not the Worker URL. It will start automatic deploy from Github.

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-deployed-project.pages.dev
```

---

## 📧 Email Routing Setup

### 🔟 Enable DMARC (Required for Each Domain)

For **each domain** you added in Step 3:

1. Cloudflare Dashboard → select the domain
2. Go to **Email → DMARC Management**
3. Click **Activate**

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Enable Email Routing

For **each domain**:

1. Go to **Build (dropdown) → Email Service → Email Routing**
2. Add your domain
3. Go to **Routing Rules**
4. Enable **Catch-all rule**
5. Set:
   - **Action:** `Send to a Worker`
   - **Destination:** select your deployed Worker project
6. Go to the **Destination Addresses** tab and **verify your email address** — this step is required or routing will not work

> Cloudflare will automatically add the required MX and TXT DNS records for you.

---

## ✅ Deployment Complete

Visit your deployed Pages URL — the application should now be fully functional and able to receive real emails on your configured domains.
